<p>In the competitive world of online streaming platforms like Netflix, Amzon, Hotstar etc. amagenerate vast amounts of data on their content and user interactions. Analyzing this data is crucial for understanding viewer preferences, content performance, and overall platform success. Using PowerBI, I have created an interactive dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into various aspects of the movies platform. This report outlines the key metrics used, the data analysis process, and the features of the interactive dashboard.</p>
